# Overview

Hello!
As a software engineering student with a passion for world languages, data analysis,
artificial intelligence, programming... and yoga! As an interdisiplinarian
I’m continually seeking opportunities to grow and sharpen my skills.
My journey in software engineering has been shaped around developing a better and different
world view. With a focus on both the logic and creativity required in software development,
I am driven to create programs that are not only functional but also elegant in their design.

The software I am presenting is a basic "Hello World" application written in C#. While simple,
this program serves as a foundation for understanding essential programming concepts such as syntax,
structure, and output in C#. It’s a small but crucial stepping stone in my journey toward building more
complex software applications.


The purpose of creating this software is to reinforce my understanding of core programming principles while
exploring the versatility of C#. By starting with this fundamental program, I am laying the groundwork for
developing larger, more intricate applications, whether it’s in data processing, goal tracking systems, or
interactive programs that require both user input and logic-based outcomes. Ultimately, my goal is to further my
learning as a software engineer and continually challenge myself to create innovative solutions.

Also to show off my sick coding environment

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
